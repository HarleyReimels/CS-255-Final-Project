# CS-255-Final-Project

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project.
DriverPass is a company that helps people study for and pass their driving exam. It does this through online study materials and tests, as well as in person driving.

What type of system did they want you to design?
A synopsis of the system is a booking system, that also has some study materials. They wanted the system to allow for the purhcase of different packages which offered different features, allow the client or admin to schedule the client with a driver on a particular day.

What did you do particularly well?
The creation of Use Case Diagrams, as well as Sequence Diagrams were done well.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? 
I would revuse my Gnatt Chart. While it does what it is supposed to, I would love to go more in depth.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? 
I interpreted the user's needs by having a conversation with the client. This allowed clarity in what their vision of the design would be. 

Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When designing we need to remember that people will be using this, every day. You could have the greatest tool in the world, but if it is a pain, no one will bother.

How do you approach designing software? 
The best way to design software is incrementally using an iterative process.

What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Creating UML Diagrams will definitely be used in the future to get a overview. Creating Class diagrams will also help to showcase how each obect interacts with the system.
